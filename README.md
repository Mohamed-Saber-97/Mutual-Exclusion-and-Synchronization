# Mutual-Exclusion-and-Synchronization
During concurrent execution of processes, processes need to enter the critical section (or the section of the program shared across processes) at times for execution. It might so happen that because of the execution of multiple processes at once, the values stored in the critical section become inconsistent. In other words, the values depend on the sequence of execution of instructions â€“ also known as a race condition. The primary task of process synchronization is to get rid of race conditions while executing the critical section.This is primarily achieved through mutual exclusion.
